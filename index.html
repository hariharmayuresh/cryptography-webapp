        Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications
        through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is
        intended can read and process it.
      </li>
      <li>
        In computer science, cryptography refers to secure information and
        communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts and a set of
        rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages in ways
        that are hard to decipher.
      </li>
      <li>
        These deterministic algorithms are used for cryptographic key
        generation, digital signing, verification to protect data privacy, web
        browsing on the internet and confidential communications such as credit
        card transactions and email.
